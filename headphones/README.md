# üéß Headphones Web Page Project

Welcome to the **Headphones** project ‚Äî part of the ALX HTML & CSS curriculum. This project challenges us to replicate a professional, responsive webpage from a Figma design using modern HTML and CSS best practices.

## üìÅ Project Structure

This project is housed in the `headphones` directory of the `alx_html_css` repository. It includes:

- `index.html`: Main HTML structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: CSS styles based on Figma's design.
- `images/`: Folder for all image assets used on the site.
- `README.md`: This file.

## üé® Design Source

The design for this project is provided via [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), a powerful UI/UX design platform. You are expected to:

1. Create a [Figma account](https://www.figma.com/signup).
2. Open the shared design link.
3. Click `Duplicate to your Drafts` to interact with the design.
4. Study and extract the necessary visual specs (font sizes, paddings, colors, etc).

## üñåÔ∏è Fonts & Design Notes

- **Fonts Used**:
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.fonts.com/font/spin-cycle)

> If the fonts are not available on your device, download and install them using the provided links.

- **Important Visual Rules**:
  - Hover/Active state for **links**: `#FF6565`
  - Hover/Active state for **buttons**: `opacity: 0.9`
  - **Max width** of content: `1000px` (centered)
  - **Responsive breakpoint**: mobile layout activates at screen widths `‚â§ 480px`
  - Some values may appear as floats in Figma ‚Äî rounding is acceptable.

## üì± Responsiveness

The webpage is **fully responsive**, adapting beautifully between desktop and mobile views:
- Mobile layout is triggered at a screen width of 480px or below.
- Layouts are adjusted using media queries and flexible CSS units.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features Implemented

- Pixel-perfect replication of the Figma design
- Clean, semantic HTML5 markup
- Fully responsive layout
- Button and link interaction feedback
- Centralized content layout (max 1000px width)
